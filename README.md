# 🌤️ SkyGraph Weather App

**SkyGraph** is a beautifully designed, graph-powered weather app built for both **iOS** and **watchOS**. It focuses on clean UI, customizable layout, and visual-first weather data.

> ⚠️ **NOTE:** API integration is **not yet connected**. The current version uses placeholder/mock data while backend development is in progress.
